# Mouse Tail Effect

A interactive web visualization that creates a trailing effect following your mouse movements using Three.js. The effect generates small spheres that follow your mouse cursor's path, creating an ethereal trail in 3D space.

## Features

- Real-time 3D mouse trail visualization
- Orbit controls for camera manipulation
- Responsive design that adapts to window resizing
- Particle system with automatic cleanup
- Smooth lighting effects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No installation required! The project uses CDN-hosted dependencies:

- Three.js (r128)

### Running the Project

1. Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Or serve it using any HTTP server of your choice

### Usage

- Move your mouse around to create trailing particles
- Click and drag to rotate the camera view
- Scroll to zoom in/out

## Technical Details

The visualization uses:

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- WebGL for hardware acceleration
- Perspective camera with orbit controls
- Phong material for sphere particles
- Ambient and point lighting for better depth perception

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support WebGL:
